Data Engineers are one of the most sought-after professionals in the IT industry today. There are a number of reasons for this. 

First and foremost, the demand for data-driven software solutions is on the rise. 
Second, most companies need a strong team of data engineers to handle the increasing influx of data in their systems. 

The data engineer is a hybrid role that combines the skills of a software developer, a data scientist, and a database administrator. 

Data engineers are responsible for the entire lifecycle of any data-driven project. They have to collect, process, store and use data for business intelligence purposes.

In this video, I have discussed one of the most asked questions related to data engineering 
Which programming language is best for Data Engineering!

Data engineering is also considered to be a subset of the broader field of data science. Data engineers are experts in data analytics and data warehousing, and they specialize in collecting, storing, and analyzing data. 

Data engineering requires dealing with huge volumes of data, and it is a highly specialized field. It is not just data collection, data access, data processing, and data storage that data engineers deal with. 

They also handle the whole process of data management, data governance, and data quality, in addition to data analytics. 

Data engineering is an ever-evolving field, and it will be even more important in the future, as the amount of data being generated grows every day.

4P37f9OfH_A,Darshil Parmar,Optimising Redshift DataWarehouse using DIST and SORT Key,"In this video, we go over the concept of DISTKEY and SORTKEY. If you're a MySQL or PostgreSQL user who is used to indexes, these two Redshift concepts might seem a bit strange. 

Redshift's DISTKEY and SORTKEY are powerful tools that are easy to use. By using these options, you can avoid issues that can be caused by Redshift's compression. Such issues include slow queries, wrong results, missing results, and more.

In fact, the way Redshift uses them, you'll probably never have a need for a fully-fledged index. Indexes are great, but they have a cost, so it's important to understand when indexes are appropriate for your workload. 

In this video, we go over the basics of DISTKEY and SORTKEY by looking at a basic example.

fHA_JYECg0c,Darshil Parmar,Easier when done this way! - Learn DSA,"Data Structure and Algorithms are two different concepts but are very much related. Data structures are the way you store data in your system, while algorithms are the way you manipulate data to get desired results. 

Both are very important to computer science. 

To be a good engineer, you have to know various data structures and algorithms. You don't have to remember everything, but knowing the names of different data structures and the problems they solve will surely help you in your interviews. 

They are important to know, but it is also important to understand why they are important. 

In this video, I have tried to elaborate on what are Data Structures and Algorithms, what are the different Data Structures, why are Data Structures important, is DSA important for Data Engineers, and many more...

SSlOklihflY,Seattle Data Guy,What Types Of Projects Should Data Teams Work On?,"Joe Reis recently wrote a piece titled, Playing Not To Lose. The piece referenced the fact that many data teams are simply going through the motions and doing ""data stuff"" as he put it.

Gordon Wong later tagged in and referenced the point of being defensive vs offensive in terms of what work you take on.

This made me want to dig even deeper into what Joe Reis meant and how he feels data teams can go on the offensive effectively to take on projects that actually are worth investing in.

Or perhaps are there certain companies that don't benefit as much from data teams?

YST1sWFPDh4,Seattle Data Guy,Extracting Data From APIs As Data Engineers - The Basics And Challenges You'll Run Into,"If you've had to build any data pipelines for analytics, then you're likely very familiar with the extract phase of an ELT or ETL.

As the name suggests the extract phase is when you connect to a data source and ""extract"" data from it. The most common data sources you'll be interacting with being databases, APIs, and file servers(via FTP or SFTP).

With my recent focus on going back to the basics, it occurred to me that I have never written about APIs and how we interact with them as data engineers.

Now, there are plenty of APIs that have caused me a lot of heartburn in my career and there are others that have been a piece of cake to handle.

But it all comes down to how the API is set up and the design choices made when it was built.

If you're looking for an out of the box solution to handle your API data extraction. You can check out the two below:

Portable For APIs - https://portable.io/

Estuary For Real Time Data Extraction -  https://bit.ly/4eQC3oQ

Disclosure - I have a financial stake in both

pQMw1T0s3RA,Seattle Data Guy,From Hackathons to Co-Founding - Analyzing Unstructured Data With SQL,"One of the benefits of working in big tech is you often build or see toolings and solutions internally that could benefit a broader audience. Whether it's a query engine or a data storage format.

Richard Meng has been working as a Staff Software Engineer at companies like Linkedin and Snowflake with data as a particular focus.

Most recently his experiences at Snowflake provided him with several insights into how LLMs can better be used to process data. In particular, unstructured data.

For example, instead of going the standard method of chunking the documents and embedding them into vectors to allow future users to ask questions of said data. Richard's team believes in directly using vision LLM on unstructured data in their raw format, which preserves the original context of said unstructured data as much as possible. 

In this live chat, I'll be focusing on Richard's experiences that led up to this point and how he is viewing LLMs impacting the work of data engineers.

eD-AeRMefiU,Seattle Data Guy,Build A Data Stack That Lasts - How To Ensure Your Data Infrastructure Is Maintainable,"As a consultant, I have been called in to review and, in many cases, replace dozens of half-finished, abandoned, and sometimes forgotten data infrastructure projects.

The data infrastructure in a few cases may just need a little tweaking to operate effectively, but other times the project is either so incomplete or so lacking in a central design that the best thing to do is replace the old system.

Trust me, I’d love it if I could come into a project and simply change a few lines of code, and then everything would just work. However, so many projects are filled with unclear design decisions or resume-driven development that were never rooted in good planning.

Of course, business stakeholders may have also push to get things done quickly. Forcing data teams to take on tech debt that will never be fixed. Don’t get me wrong, you want to get things done and move projects forward. But taking on technical debt is a decision that needs to be made intentionally. Otherwise, like in resume driven development, your data infrastructure might disappear.

This begs the question.

How do you ensure the data infrastructure you’re building doesn’t get replaced as soon as you leave in the future?

In this article I wanted to dive into the problems I often come into that require me to replace the current data infrastructure and how you can avoid it.

So let’s dive in.

uKLscjh__Yc,Seattle Data Guy,What Is Databricks Genie And Should You Use It - Testing Out Databricks Genie,"Databricks is releasing several new features meant to help users both technical and non-technical access data and ask questions of it.

But is it good enough to replace analysts, tableau and our current approach?

In this video Josue Bogran (https://www.linkedin.com/in/josuebogran/) will be walking through an example and I'll let you decide your thoughts.

But here was some of Josue thoughts from a recent post.

AI/BI Dashboards, are they good enough to replace Tableau?

In about 1 year to 1.5 years, yes. Right now, it is suitable for developers, but dashboards are not quite polished yet for CFO/leadership level. Likely 6 months to be polished enough for mid management usage. For now, keeping Tableau, PBI or Sigma is what works.

AI/BI Genie, how impactful is it?
I am a big believer in the value and capabilities it will have as the product matures. To get to that level of maturity, I believe it will be worst case scenario 2 years from now and best case scenario, 1 year. It is the sweet-spot between LLMs and your data, with Genie being similar to an intern that learns more and more about your preferences and how to provide data to you.

n74ke0Wjmi4,Seattle Data Guy,Don't Lead A Data Team Before Watching This - 5 Lessons You Need To Know As A Head of Data,"Recently, I heard 2-to 3 data leaders say that the default state of most data teams is failure. But I don’t think most data teams are set up for success to start with(I also don’t believe that failure is the default state).

I do however, find that many data engineers, analysts, and scientists get thrown into the role of Head of Data or perhaps director and don’t get much in the way of coaching or advice. 

There is just the expectation that we will do a good job because we were a good individual contributor.

So I wanted to start to put together a list of what you need to know and do to be successful as a leader in the data space.

This ranges from taking even more time to understand the business to being intentional on how you hire and place talent.

So if you’re thinking of leading a data team or perhaps already are this is for you!

9VfdW-cH2gw,Seattle Data Guy,Going From Data Engineer To Head Of Data - How To Run A Data Team Successfully,"You join a 1000 person company as the head of data. What should you do?

I would invest a a lot of time up front to understand the business(especially if you haven't worked in the industry).

I was just talking to someone at the Snowflake Summit who told me they made the mistake of recently being put in charge of a data team and their first response was ""Great, what tools can I use"".

If you can't answer the following questions within the first month or two, you're probably going in the wrong direction.

- What are the main drivers of the business?
- What are the main pain points of the customers?
- What does the business flow look like?
- Who is our customer?
- (What other questions would you add)

More than likely, if you're a Head Of Data, you've hopefully got the technical chops to excel in the role. 

But if you don't have a strong understanding of the business, you'll either end up becoming a task taker who struggles to get out of ad-hoc requests or you'll build a bunch of fancy infrastructure that delivers nothing for the business.

6ldUZ4iHxI8,Seattle Data Guy,Apache Spark Vs Apache Flink – Looking Through How Different Companies Approach Spark And Flink,"As data increased in volume, velocity, and variety, so, in turn, did the need for tools that could help process and manage those larger data sets coming at us at ever faster speeds.

As a result, frameworks such as Apache Spark and Apache Flink became popular due to their abilities to handle big data processing in a fast, efficient, and scalable manner.

But we often find that sometimes it can be difficult to understand which use cases are best suited for Spark as well as for Flink (or even which might be suited for both).

In this article, we’ll discuss some of those unique benefits for both Spark and Flink and help you understand the difference between the two, and go over real use cases, including ones where the engineers were trying to decide between Spark vs. Flink.

9CSjgKI363M,Seattle Data Guy,8 Years Of Data Consulting - 9 Of The Best Lessons I Have Learned While Consulting,"One of the first challenges I faced as a new data consultant was writing my first statement of work.

I know, it seems like a simple problem, but honestly when the prospect asked for one, I realized I never really planned this far.

I had spent the past few months marketing and networking, doing whatever I could to try to get prospects to talk to me and now that someone was interested I realized I didn't have a clue what to do.

Suddenly I was Googling SOW templates and looking for some consistency or pattern that could lead me to a clear answer(there really wasn't much). Eventually, I found a few templates I like and have expanded them over the years.

The past near decade of consulting has taught me a lot from marketing, to creating offers and running projects.

I wanted to put together a live where I talk through some of these lessons and have y'all ask questions. Feel free let me know if you have any!

The concept of slowly changing dimensions wasn't as prevalent and instead we simply stored snapshots of data every day.

So let's talk about modeling historical data and how it varied.

nhS7KhuNqQU,Seattle Data Guy,The History And Future Of Real-time Analytics - With David Yaffe,"If you’ve worked in data for any period of time, you've either worked on real-time analytics or don't think it exists, depending on your team. 

We hear the term brought up by end-users who may mean “real-time” as in daily or hourly uploads. It could also mean up to the millisecond operationally important workflows that require fine-tuning and perhaps a tool or two to make it easy.

But how have real-time workflows changed over the years and where is it heading? 

In order to discuss this topic I wanted to bring on David from Estuary who has been dealing with real-time problems since the Adtech boom in the 2010s.

He and his team built an open source solution Gazette which helped them outflank the rest of the realtime ad-tech companies. 

Now in 2024, we’ll talk about how real-time has changed and where he sees it going.

David is also the CEO of Estuary.dev, which if you're looking for real-time data ingestion then you should check it out here - https://bit.ly/3Ed1RLe",,1410,49,0,0,3395.0,hd,false,Wednesday,2024-03-20,03:02:03

In this article, I wanted to discuss some of the services that are useful to know as a data engineer as well as provide a combination of real-world examples where I have used said services. I’ll also only be focusing on AWS for now.

So let’s dive into the cloud services you should know as a data engineer.

Bs6UgJccEoI,Seattle Data Guy,Optimizing Your Data Infrastructure - How To Become A Better Data Engineer,"I once had an engineer tell me that they essentially didn’t want to consider cost as they were building a solution. I was baffled. Don’t get me wrong, yes, when you’re building, you iterate and aim to improve your solutions cost.

But from my perspective, I don’t think completely ignoring costs from day one is a good plan.

Cost plays a role in all forms of projects, whether you’re building bridges or writing code. How much budget is allocated to build and maintain a solution is important. In the real world, it can change the materials used, the timeline, or the final product’s design.

In the tech world it also plays a similar role, and it can help you build more optimal systems.

Thanks all for watching.

If you're looking to improve your data infrastructure or reduce your costs, you can set up a free consult below.

wvUiRHd47M0,Seattle Data Guy,How And Why Data Engineers Need To Care About Data Quality Now - And How To Implement It,"As companies look to incorporate AI and ML into their data strategies and roadmaps, there is a new opportunity to refocus on data quality.

Regardless of how fancy or sophisticated a company's AI model might be, poor data quality will make the outputs of these models useless at best, and misleading and company destroying at worst.

So, as your company is rolling out its internally developed LLM or implementing a dynamic pricing model, it’s a great time to review your data quality strategy.

The first key point to cover is that data quality is not limited to one pillar, like accuracy. But instead, several key pillars need to be considered when developing your data quality system.

gkKY6Q3GApw,Seattle Data Guy,The Realities Of Airflow - The Mistakes New Data Engineers Make Using Apache Airflow,"Airflow remains a popular choice when it comes to open-source orchestration tools.

When I surveyed people about a year ago now, it was the most popular open-source solution, and still to this day, my video on “Should You Use Airflow” drives a lot of prospect conversations.

Now, I do want to say that there are plenty of organizations using Azure Data Factory and Informatica, and there are plenty of competitors knocking on Airflow's door.

But for now, Airflow is like the PHP of the data world; people can talk poorly about it, but it continues to be heavily relied upon.

Now, as I said, Airflow is often why I get brought into many projects, meaning I have seen many different ways that teams decide to deploy Airflow.

Some scaled, others didn’t.

Thus, I wanted to take a moment and discuss some ways I have seen Airflow deployed in the past and the challenges people faced as they deployed their code.

If your team is looking to deploy Airflow, or needs help setting up Airflow, then set up a consultation here - https://calendly.com/ben-rogojan/consultation

Also, if you'd like to learn about an alternative to Airflow, you can check out Mage.ai(https://bit.ly/41h6Pjy)

ax5DPeKNUKg,Seattle Data Guy,"Planning Out Your Data Roadmap For 2024 - Talking Data Strategy, Infra, And Teams","Not every data team will be viewed as a strategic partner to the business.

Sometimes, no matter how much the business claims to want to be data-driven, they never truly invest in their data organization.

But if you do want your data team to play a strategic role in your business. 

If you genuinely want to figure out how to set up the data infrastructure, create the processes, and develop a data team that can start to maximize your data.

Then now is a great time to do it. 

It’s the end of the year meaning people are ready to start thinking about 2024!

Whether you’re on the business side or the data side, taking a moment to plan out your data roadmap for 2024 can help shift your data team from a service organization to a strategic one.

36yR3FGdGl0,Seattle Data Guy,Structuring Data Teams And Self Serve Analytics With Ethan Aaron,"How should companies set-up their data teams.

There are so many different ways I have seen data teams configured.

Sometimes the data engineering team is centralized while the analysts all work directly with their departments.

Other times the DEs and DAs are in pods that are connected to finance, HR, operations, etc.

But when should companies look to change how they are organizing their teams?

And to which set-up?

These are some of the questions I will be asking Ethan Aaron, CEO of Portable next week. 

You can follow Ethan here - https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanaaron/

CJUYTO3lbTw,Seattle Data Guy,How Data Analytics Teams Can Deliver What The Business Needs,"Data analytics teams at the end of the day need to deliver. 

We can talk about the perfect architecture or tools but those are just meant to make delivering easier.

So even as a data analytics team is building, it's important that they keep iterating and delivering the data and metrics the business needs to make decisions.

That brings up the question.

How do data teams balance delivering and ensuring what they are building is maintainable and flexible?

That way, when the business asks for some new report or needs some data that might not already be ingested, it's easy to get to.

What exactly makes up an effective data team?

I am going to talk to Tom Rampley, A Data Analytics Director with nearly 10 years of experience managing data teams, how to make sure data teams stay effective.

There are so many requests often coming from every part of the business and the constant need for higher quality data.

To help answer this question I am talking with Sule Baptiste, Director Of Data Science at Healthfirst.

l58yH2aOoJU,Seattle Data Guy,Everyone's Data Infrastructure Is A Mess  - The Truth About Working As A Data Engineer,"Is everyone’s data a mess?

Recently, I came across a post in the data engineering subreddit that asked the question.


The answer is yes, but no.

As someone who has seen data infrastructure at FAANGs, Enterprises, start-ups, and every other company in between, all companies need to make some concessions that can build up and become messy over a long period of time.

So let’s discuss some of the causes of data infrastructure becoming messy and how some companies are trying to deal with it.

Also, I forgot to cover a very important topic!

That is all of the mess often starts at the data source.

hNJCxF3IWC4,Seattle Data Guy,What Is Change Data Capture - Understanding Data Engineering 101,"Companies continue to look for methods to gain near-real-time access to their data for analytics. Honestly, this has been ongoing since I got into the data industry a decade ago…and well before that.

One possible choice is a method called change data capture, also known as CDC. I have seen companies employ multiple ways to use CDC or CDC-like approaches to pull data from databases like Postgres or MongoDB. 

This can range from using triggers to reading logs.

Of course, this focuses on the analytical component as many companies use CDC to replace or supplement traditional ETL/ELT.

But CDC can also be a great way to understand your database and its structure. Databases abstract much of what they do to manage and process large volumes of data quickly. 

Here are a a few articles on CDC if you need to learn more

So I wanted to discuss the difference between data engineering vs machine learning pipelines.

To answer this question, I pulled in Sarah Floris, who is both an experienced data engineer as well as the author behind the newsletter The Dutch Engineer.

So let’s dive in.

0DsaafI1fTQ,Seattle Data Guy,Do You REALLY Need A Data Warehouse - What Are The Benefits Of A Data Warehouse?,"Recently several consulting calls started with people asking, “Do we need a data warehouse?”

This isn’t a question about whether you need data warehouse consultants, but instead whether you should event start a data warehouse project. Which is a very fair question. Not every company needs a data warehouse.

That being said data warehouses can provide a lot of benefits.

They help centralize data, provide an easy access layer for data analysts and more. But they aren’t always a worthwhile investment. Our team has helped some companies develop far lighter weight solutions in order to keep costs low.

If your company is trying to answer the question, do you need a data warehouse, then set up a consultation call with me today! 

https://calendly.com/ben-rogojan/consultation

I wrote an article to help answer that question as well here

Q4WM1Ca9tKA,Seattle Data Guy,Getting Promoted As An Engineer - How To Go From Junior To Staff,"60% of the respondents to my 2022 State Of Data survey aren’t confident they know what is required to get a promotion. This made me re-examine what I know about leveling and skill expectations.

Seriously, what is expected at different levels?

I have found that tech companies will break down what is expected pretty clearly(even if it’s not always followed to a T ). Different levels are based on the axes they find valuable.

This could be based on axes such as the ones stated by Omar Halabieh (Head of Technology at Amazon Payment Services) which were:

Independence
Complexity
Scope
Ambiguity
Influence
Impact

Facebook also had a similar set of axes including impact, direction, scope, people, and engineering excellence. I would say tech companies are in the minority when it comes to having clear axes and expectations (based on discussions I have had). Most people I have talked to find that their promotions in standard enterprise companies are somewhat attached to project deliverables, years of experience, and the hands of fate.

That aside, for this article, I will be focusing on breaking down the expectations at various levels for scope, influence, impact, complexity, and independence.

I explained that one of the major issues is that MongoDB wasn't built for complex analytical queries. Both in terms of its structure and its query language. 

So I suggested they look into OLAP. But they weren't sure what that was, so I decided to make a video about databases vs data warehouses vs data lakes.

syN4rGwE0rg,Seattle Data Guy,What Is A Data Catalog And Why Do People Use Them?,"Special Thanks To Atlan For Partnering With Me On This Video. Learn more about them here: https://bit.ly/3VMCCXV

What is a data catalog? 

iData was Facebook’s data discoverability tool. It provided a lot of functionality that I have started to miss. This included the baseline functions you would expect including the ability to find tables, trace lineage, and track down owners of said tables.

But there were also other beneficial features like cost tracking, data quality assessments, and table certification. All of these features made it easy for a new data engineer to quickly orient themselves as they started on new projects.

My Favorite iData Feature
My favorite features involved being able to see how other users were using the data on a query level. This provided a lot more context than just commented fields. ERDs and data lineage are all great. But seeing exactly how other users were using the data made it easy to understand(also they were great people to ping if you had questions).

It was so easy to quickly understand how the data was already being used. This provided several benefits including:

Reducing the duplication of work

Providing context on how data could join together(even across multiple data sources)

It would let you know who to ask questions about the data. Sure, the owner is one great place to start, but sometimes owners, over time, move away from datasets

Upon leaving the company formerly known as Facebook I felt like I kept stumbling on a new data catalog or discoverability tool every week. At this point, I am sure I have come across at least 3-5 dozen data discovery tools all of which add their own flair to helping teams manage their metadata.

I don't work for Palantir. I just kept seeing videos about Snowflake vs Palantir and I wanted to dig into Palantir so I could understand the difference.

goT7gN1lwBI,Seattle Data Guy,Why Are Data Teams Still Struggling To Answer Basic Questions,"“Why do we still struggle to answer basic questions like how many customers are still active or what exactly is the company’s churn?”

This was a question posed to a panel I was sitting on at the Snowflake Summit. Several panelists provided different answers and all come from very different perspectives. Truth be told I have mulled over this question for the last few years as I worked on projects that involved reconciling basic numbers like several active customers or total sales for a company.

Metrics most would assume would be easy to calculate but continue to plague companies even after they spent large amounts of their budget trying to build robust data infrastructure.

Rarely is this due to one cause. Over the years I have seen a multitude of reasons why companies struggle to answer basic questions. These reasons range from constant turnover of developers, ERP and CRM migrations, producers of data constantly changing what data they provide, and mergers and acquisitions(of course there are still more reasons). All in all, trying to continually report even basic numbers can prove to be very challenging when the underlying components are constantly shifting, but let’s discuss some of these issues and how we can try to mitigate them.

8FZZivIfJVo,Seattle Data Guy,What Is DBT and Why Is It So Popular -  Intro To Data Infrastructure Part 3,"What Is dbt?

Built by Fishtown Analytics (now dbt Labs), the data build tool or dbt allows data analysts, data engineers and analytics engineers to execute the “transform“ step in the Extract-Load-Transform pipeline.

They can do this by writing transforms  in SQL and executes it against its company’s database. 

Dubbed as the “analytics engineering tool,” dbt is also open source and has become a regular part of the modern data stack of many companies. It also has had a solid support community formed around it.

Also, if you'd like to dive deeper into data strategy and infrastructure and you'd like to support me,  you can consider becoming a paid member of my Substack.

njttWa08pwo,Seattle Data Guy,Why Everyone Cares About Snowflake,"Scrolling through Linkedin, I continue to find other data engineers who echo the same sentiment I have when it comes to cloud data warehouses.

That is to say that Snowflake and Bigquery are dominating the market.

But here is the thing, According to Slintel, Amazon Redshift is still dominating the market with 26.36%( of course it doesn’t take much searching to find completely different numbers and ranking on different sites for the same few products).

So perhaps that point is moot.

What isn’t moot is the underlying current among data professionals who have had a chance up to use Snowflake.

Many seem to enjoy it?

The question is.

Why?

You will have multiple bosses and stakeholders.

You will constantly need to balance gaining new clients while keeping current clients happy and so on.

-Gk47wz1DIw,Seattle Data Guy,Is Tom Nash Wrong About Snowflake Vs Palantir - Can Palantir Replace The Modern Data Stack?,"This week I have been digging into Palantir’s tool called Foundry. I have buried myself deep into Stack Overflow questions about Foundry, looked into their AWS integrations, and watched multiple CGI and product demos of how companies could use Foundry as an all-in-one data tool.

Why?
Because I realized that Palantir is trying to take on the entire modern data stack. All in one tool.

Don’t believe me? Just check out some of their marketing materials on the Foundry main page.


They think they have the answer to analytics and the entire data infrastructure stack.

I guess I should stop writing my series on the baseline data stack huh?

But let’s drill into this more before I give up on the last few articles I wrote.

Tools and technology are just that.

🛠️ Tools.

They won’t actually drive any form of impact on their own.

They won’t develop processes that are connected to dashboards that in turn drive actions without people. Nor are the numbers they are creating going to magically jump off the screen and fix a business.

So before building any data pipeline it’s important to consider a few things.

W2L7Q3J-ei0,Seattle Data Guy,SQL Interview Questions For Data Scientists And Data Engineers - Tips For Practicing SQL Interviews,"SQL has become a common skill requirement across industries and job profiles over the last decade.

Companies like Amazon and Google will often demand that their data analysts, data scientists and product managers are at least be familiar with SQL. This is because SQL remains the language of data.
 
So, in order to be data-driven, people need to know how to access and analyze data.

With so many people looking at, slicing, manipulating, and analyzing data we wanted to provide some tips to help improve your SQL.

wuiJWSz-OLQ,Seattle Data Guy,How To Become A GREAT Data Analyst - 5 Skills And Best Practices For Data Analysts,"Data analysis is abstract. It is not math (although math is involved) and it is not English or accounting. It requires a hands-on approach to truly understand the pitfalls good analysts will run into.

Yet, most students have not dealt with vague parameters and large data sets by the time they get their first job, which is a shame! Many students haven’t even heard of a data warehouse and this is where most of the data, which helps managers make critical decisions, resides.

In the modern business world, data analysis is not limited to data scientists. It is also key for analysts, system engineers, financial teams, PR, HR, marketing, and so on.

kW8_l57w74g,Seattle Data Guy,Top Courses To Become A Data Engineer In 2022,"Learning how to become a data engineer in 2022 isn't' easy.

When you look at all the different job descriptions, it seems like they are making up half of the technologies they reference. 

This makes it hard to keep up. That's where online courses can come in.
Don’t let the number of courses available online overwhelm you. If you’re not sure where to start, or you’re taking far too many courses at the same time like I am, then look for a course that offers these features.

9vRfTZdbjtM,Seattle Data Guy,They Left A FAANG After Only 4 Months - (Did They Make A Mistake?),"A few days ago a redditor posted on the data engineering subreddit that they quit facebook after only 4 Months

Part of what they said was that:

A lot of the data at Meta is generated in-house, by the products that they've developed. This means that any data generated or collected is made available through the logs, which are then parsed and stored in tables. There are no APIs to connect to, CSVs to ingest, or tools that need to be connected so they can share data. It's just tables. The pipelines that parse the logs have, for the most part, already been built, and thus your job as a DE is to work with the tables that are created every night. I found this incredibly boring because I get more joy/satisfaction out of working with really dirty, raw data. That's where I feel I can add value. But data at Meta is already pretty clean just due to the nature of how it's generated and collected. If your joy/satisfaction comes from helping Data Scientists make the most of the data that's available, then FAANG is definitely for you. But if you get your satisfaction from making unusable data usable, then this likely isn't what you're looking for.

-ClWgwC0Sbw,Seattle Data Guy,What Is The Modern Data Stack - Intro To Data Infrastructure Part 1,"To put things simply, the modern data stack (MDS) is a set of tools that power data integration. In order, these tools include a fully managed data pipeline for “extract, load, and transform” (ELT) processes along with a cloud-based data lake or columnar warehouse for the data’s destination. On top of that, MDS requires a data transformation tool and a visualization or business intelligence (BI) platform so your company can make use of all the numbers.

The primary difference between a modern data stack and a legacy data stack lies in the host. The modern data stack is hosted in the cloud and, as a result, requires very little technical interference from its users. The modern data stack almost guarantees end-user accessibility, while the company at-large enjoys endless scalability that grows quickly without the expensive downtime associated with scaling the server room that supports a legacy data stack.

PEsCumjfBW0,Seattle Data Guy,How I Would Become A Data Engineer in 2022,"How would I become a data engineer in 2022? Back in the ""old"" days you would likely need to spend time working as an analyst for a few years before even considering a Data engineering role. 

In 2022, I am seeing more internships and jr. data engineering positions. 

So there is a chance you might be able to find a role out of college...as long as companies don't expect 2 years of experience for a jr. position.

bqCXVpRqTpE,Seattle Data Guy,What I Learned From 100+ Data Engineering Interviews - Interview Tips,"Data engineering interviews are tough.

Interviewing for any technical position generally requires preparing, studying, and long, all-day interviews.

Data engineering interviews, like other technical interviews, require plenty of preparation. There are a number of subjects that need to be covered in order to ensure you are ready for back-to-back questions.

Some positions require Hadoop, others SQL. Some roles require understanding statistics, while still others require heavy amounts of system design.

We have gathered many of the resources that we have used to study and get jobs at companies in the FAANG family as well as other major tech companies. We have yet to find one that requires you to know anything about Hadoop during the interview, so that has not been included in this study guide.

eTtrsGc4Wd4,Seattle Data Guy,Setting Up Airflow 101 - Google Cloud Composer Vs Astronomer Vs MWAA,"Over the last 3 months, I have taken on two different migrations that involved taking companies from manually managing Airflow VMs to going over to using Cloud Composer and MWAA (Managed Workflows For Apache Airflow).

These are two great options when it comes to starting your first Airflow project. They help reduce a lot of issues such as scaling workloads across workers and managing all the other various components required to run Airflow at scale.

Of course, both Cloud Composer and MWAA are services provided by two of the larger cloud providers. But there is a third option called Astronomer.

In this article, I want to discuss some of the benefits and limitations of Cloud Composer and MWAA as well as discuss why Astronomer might be a better fit for many companies.

You fought your way through all the complex interviews and negotiated yourself an amazing salary. Honestly, for your first job ever, it’s way more than you had ever thought you could make.

This is the place where people like Larry Ellison and Reid Hoffman planted their billion-dollar companies and now it is time for you to get your piece!
You landed in SFO an hour ago and you have already seen 4 Waymo cars and overheard a few phone calls with people using words like burn-rate and mentioning 50 million dollar as if it were nothing.

It’s all exciting and a little overwhelming considering you came from a smaller town in middle America where things were a little bit slower. But that’s not going to stop you!

As data engineers, you play vital roles in your field by collecting and analyzing data. But necessary data engineer skills today aren’t the same as they were in years past, and the role is seeing some serious growing pains. We wrote about data analytics in a previous post, but let’s focus on some challenges for data engineers.

Data Engineers Must Learn On Their Feet

One of the biggest challenges, and the root of many others, is that data engineering is a relatively new and dynamic discipline. 

So lets talk about some of these data engineering challenges.

J6r2y8-CMJ4,Seattle Data Guy,Datacamp Vs Dataquest? Which Data Engineering Course Is Best - Learning Data Engineering Online,"Learning data engineering online is hard enough.

So which track is best, Datacamp vs Dataquest?

Don't take my word for it. Please check out both Datacamp and Dataquest's free sections. 

Both do provide some of their initial courses and sections for free. So try them out with the courses below.

Datacamp Data Engineering Track
* https://bit.ly/3i1XqsK

Dataquest.io
https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-fundamentals-de/


Now, I come out more positively for Datacamp, which I also have an affiliate link for. So I will share both below and allow you to pick which one you like best.

I preferred datacamp only because it had a more realistic view of what a data engineer does. I imagine at some point dataquest will have to also create similar courses if it wants to compete. If this occurs, I will happily make a follow-up video rexamining the two.


Both have data engineering course

In early 2019, the company made an unprecedented commitment to data quality and formed a comprehensive plan to address the organizational and technical challenges we were facing around data. Airbnb leadership signed off on the Data Quality initiative — a project of massive scale to rebuild the data warehouse from the ground up using new processes and technology.

x9T2fmuVzk0,Seattle Data Guy,Building ELTs and Data Pipelines Faster With Rivery And SnowflakeDB - Scraping Youtube Data,"There are plenty of clichés about data and its likeness to oil. But it’s far from easy to get value from data.

Companies are creating more data than ever before. At our current pace, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every day. Companies went from pulling data solely from their CRM and ERP systems to pulling data from dozens or hundreds of data sources simultaneously. 

Creating data pipelines for all of these data sources is expensive and difficult to maintain. Data engineers are often stretched thin, between constantly updating API connections, to building new pipelines for every data source. Without access to this data, analysts and data scientists cannot provide key insights for organizational stakeholders. 

But, in the last decade, software solutions have emerged that can pull data from many different data sources without requiring companies to build infrastructure manually. These managed, low-code platforms increase efficiency and time-to-insights, while freeing engineers to work on more important projects.

Data engineering and data science interviews, like other technical interviews, require plenty of preparation. There are a number of subjects that need to be covered in order to ensure you are ready for back-to-back questions.

Some positions require Hadoop, others SQL. Some roles require understanding statistics, while still others require heavy amounts of system design.

So we put together a study guide here:

4Vh6Zj5QLU4,Seattle Data Guy,Machine Learning And MLOps Roadmap - Learning MLOps In 16-20 Week Plan #machinelearning #mlops,"What is MLOps, and more importantly, how can you learn more about it quickly?

I put together a roadmap for MLOps.

MLOps Roadmap - https://bit.ly/3wL2wO4

If you want to learn more about machine learning and you need a course, then check out DataCamps Machine Learning Course

*https://bit.ly/3BeLEml

So What Is MLOps?

A group of Google researchers put out a paper titled Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt. This paper pointed out a growing problem that many companies might have been ignoring.

Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning. [D. Sculley, Gary Holt, etc]

Another way the researchers put this in a follow-up presentation was that launching a rocket was easy, but ongoing operations afterwards was hard. Back then, the concept of DevOps was still coming into its own, but these engineers and researchers realized that there were many more complications in terms of deploying a machine learning model vs. deploying code.

This is when the popularity of machine learning platforms began to rise. Eventually, many of these platforms adopted the term MLOps to explain the service they were providing.

Back to my story:

Early in my career I started as an analyst working in healthcare but I eventually found myself in the role of data engineer at a FAANG and it's really been a great learning experience. 

Along the way I learned how to operate on an engineering team.

How to follow good engineering practices and just in general, develop maintainable systems.

Now that companies are starting to hire even more rapidly for data engineers, I wanted to provide my story for how I went from being a data analyst to data engineer.

From taking the initiative to develop products, to self learning. All of it was required to really challenge myself to be a DE.

3ecKZFBQDJM,Seattle Data Guy,Scaling A Data Team At A BILLION Dollar Start-Up - With Veronica Zhai,"This week I will be interviewing Veronica Zhai and talking about her journey from working as a Trader at JP Morgan to her dive into being a leader in the data analytics space and eventually finding herself as a Principal Product Manager at Fivetran. 

Veronica is currently a principal product manager at the analytics team in Fivetran. She is responsible for the overall analytics roadmap and execution at Fivetran. Over the last 6 months, she helped scale the team from less than 10 people to almost 20. Prior to joining Fivetran, she started her career as an option trader and went on to build the first analytics stack at J.P. Morgan. 

Tomorrow we will be discussing her journey as well as asking her how she manages an analytical team successfully and how she is working to scale it with the needs of Fivetran’s business.

For example, let's look at this set of technical skills required from a real job description taken off Indeed.com.

You might need to take a break halfway through reading.

The Job Description
Experience with Jenkins and Terraform managed AWS infrastructure.

Experience with AWS services (ECR, Lambda, SQS, CloudWatch, Route53).

Hands on programming with Elixir, Python and Java.

Comfortable with support tools (Docker, Git, Bash, AWS CLI)

Production experience with ETL and asynchronous pipelines.

Experience with relational (Postgres/RDS) and nosql (DynamoDB) databases.

Demonstrated ability to actively participate in the design of complex systems.

Production network operations familiarity a plus.

Understanding of ML principles and NLP experience, Kaggle competitions a plus.

Experience with data science libraries (Scikit, NLTK, Gensim, TensorFlow, Keras).

Do You Have All Those Skills?
So apparently this job is looking for a software engineer, data engineer, machine learning engineer, and DevOps engineer all in one.

In some ways, that is a little ridiculous.

Do software engineers really need all these skills these days?

Honestly, yeah, kind of.

But, also...kind of no.

But one other skill that wasn't mentioned was data engineering. If you're interested in learning more about data engineering, then check out the resources below.

Whether they are analysts who want to switch roles into data engineering or CS students who are looking at big data as a career.

There are lots of valid reasons why you should look towards certification programs like the Google Cloud Data Engineering certificate.

I spent the last month going through the certification and have plenty of thoughts.

I think the overall program covers a lot of core concepts for data engineers.

They cover a lot of key concepts.

However, I do think you will need to round out what they cover with some of the resources below:

See the video here: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385mKftVr3I&t=1s

But what if you want to make your own?

Where should you start?

Often, finding the right dataset is the hardest part of putting together an effective project.

To assist you in your journey of project development, this video will curate a list of data sources that can be utilized for data engineering. I will also outline a few ways that other developers have implemented these datasets for you to draw inspiration from.

This often requires you develop another snippet of code to connect to another API.

In turn your team is then responsible in terms of maintaining and updating that connector whenever an analyst or data scientist needs new information or the API changes.

This is time consuming and often repetitive.

Enter Airbyte, an early-stage startup that is building an open-source data integration platform to help solve that problem.

dyfQoklmjAk,Seattle Data Guy,The Last Advanced SQL Tutorial You Will Ever Need To Watch As A Data Scientist Or Engineer,"SQL is becoming a common skill requirement  across industries.

Companies like Amazon and Google often will require their data analysts, data scientists and product managers to at least be familiar with SQL. This is because SQL remains the language of data. So, in order to be data driven, people need to know how to access and analyze data.

With so many people looking at, slicing, manipulating and analyzing data with SQL we wanted to create the last advanced SQL tutorial you will ever need.

This is the start of a larger series where we will be working on helping you create a SQL project.

Whether you are a data engineer or data analyst this will be a great series for you to work on your sql portfolio.

If you want to learn SQL, consider taking a udemy course.

You can rest assured that the influx of data engineering will not regress anytime soon. To bolster this supposition, the International Data Group (IDG) predicts that the five year compound growth rate (CAGR) of data utilization from 2021 to 2024 will outweigh the total data creation spanning the entirety of the last thirty years. Yes, you heard that correctly, thirty years, dating back far before the origins of both FaceBook, YouTube and Amazon.

We have established that data engineering is a well-paying position, in one of the fastest-growing tech fields, with relatively low competition. What is not to love?

It really shouldn't be about time at a company but skill.

However, skill isn't just technical. Yes, as you become more senior you should play a larger role in making design decisions. However, it is how you communicate and own those design decisions that can also make a huge impact.

There are a number of soft skills developers should emphasize which all have the potential to exponentially increase the impact.

Code review etiquette, saying no to avoid scope creep or better manage resources, communicating, simplifying complex concepts and leadership in general.

All of these skills are very different from what our focus on.

But being a senior engineer, doesn't just mean you are the best programmer.

https://bit.ly/3eVDrKG

We recently wrote about ETLs and why they’re important. We wanted to provide an outline for what ETL tools are. You could refer to these ETL tools as workflow tools that help manage moving data from point A to point B.

Two of these popular workflow tools are Luigi by Spotify and Airflow by Airbnb. Both of these workflow engines have been developed to help in the design and execution of computationally heavy workflows that are used for data analysis.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgSHaOvNodA&t=5s

What Is a DAG?

Now before comparing Airflow to Luigi, it’s important we understand an important concept both libraries have in common. Both, essentially, build what is known as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAG is a collection of tasks that run in a specific order with dependencies on previous tasks.

For example, if we had three tasks named Foo, Bar, and FooBar, it might be the case that Foo runs first and Bar and FooBar depend on Foo finishing.

This would create a basic graph like the one below. As you can see, there’s a clear path. Now imagine this with tens of hundreds of tasks.

Large data organizations have massive DAGs with dependencies on dependencies. Having clear access to the DAG allows companies to track where things are going wrong and doesn’t allow bad data into their data ecosystems because if something fails, it’ll often force the tasks downstream to wait until their dependencies are complete.

This is where tools like Airflow and Luigi come in handy.","big data, data analytics, tableau, sql, big query, business, smb, data engineer, how to become a data engineer, apache airflow, luigi data, building your first etl, data pipelines, how to manage big data, learn to become a data engineer, data airflow, data engineering, data science, python",38638,815,0,38,934.0,hd,false,Friday,2021-05-07,16:40:02

Whether you are looking at cloud data warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery or real-time solutions it can be quite jarring.

Not to mention all of the different ways companies have decided to implement their solutions.

In this live stream we are going to talk to Nadine Farah of Rockset and ask for her perspective on what a serverless database is and how it is impacting development. 

Nadine Farah is a senior developer advocate at Rockset leading Rockset's developer initiatives. You can find her leading live coding workshops on Twitch with @rocksetcloud or working on some cool projects. Prior to Rockset, she was at Bose working with the Bose AR team. When Nadine is not working on software projects, she's probably getting dog-pressured to play fetch.

Data science  and data engineering interviews, like other technical interviews, require plenty of preparation. There are a number of subjects that need to be covered in order to ensure you are ready for back-to-back questions on statistics, programming and machine learning.

Before we get started, there’s one tip I’d like to share.

If we just look at data science interview you will notice that there are several types of interviews that companies conduct.

Some data science interviews are very product and metric driven. These interviews focus more on asking product questions like what kind of metrics would you use to show what you should improve in a product. These are often paired with SQL and some Python questions.

The other type of data science interview tends to be a mix of programming and machine learning.

We recommend asking the recruiter if you aren’t sure which type of interview you will be facing. Some companies are very good at keeping interviews consistent, but even then, teams can deviate depending on what they are looking for. Here are some examples of what we have noticed about some companies data science interviews.

Airbnb — Product heavy, metrics diagnostics, metrics creation, A/B testing, tons of behavioral questions and take home material.

Netflix — Product-sense questions, A/B testing, experimental design, metric design

Microsoft — Programming heavy, binary tree traversal, SQL, machine learning

Expedia — Product, programming, SQL, product sense, machine learning questions about SVM, regression and decision tree

0wjngjhmtJA,Seattle Data Guy,Software Engineer Vs. Data Engineer - Is There A Difference?,"Software engineers vs data engineers

What is the difference between a data engineer and a software engineer?

This answer can vary depending on which company and or team you are working on.

In some cases data engineers are more like software engineers that focus on data.

In other cases data engineers are more like BI developers.

This wide range makes it difficult for data engineers as well as companies to really articulate what they want and their skill sets.

Hopefully this video helps discuss some of those differences.

What is a data engineer and should you become one?


The goals of a data engineer are much more big-picture and development focused. Data engineers build automated systems and model data structures to allow data to be efficiently processed.


This means the goal of a data engineer is to create and develop tables and data pipelines to support analytical dashboards and other data customers (like data scientists, analysts, and other engineers). 


It's similar to most engineers. There is a lot of design, assumptions, limitations, and development that occurs to be able to create some sort of final robust system.

In order to dive in further into big data, we need to understand how one can work on it — and that’s where data engineering comes in.

If you want to learn more about data engineering, check out DataCamp's data engineering bootcamp.

* https://bit.ly/3i1XqsK

Now back to the intro:

Simply put, data engineering is all about managing big datasets and extracting information from them efficiently and accurately.
What’s a Data Engineer?

A data engineer is someone who’s responsible for maintaining and building the architecture of data in a DS project.

Some of the main roles and responsibilities of a data engineer include having to ensure an uninterrupted flow of data between server and application, integrating new data management software, improving data foundational processes, and building data pipelines.

The truth is there are lots of various technologies and concepts that data engineers need to take on — working with cloud computing, ETLs, data warehouses, and so much more.

The requirement of data engineers is constantly expanding, and thus we constantly need to continue learning what is changing in the technology world.

In this video, we’ll talk about the top courses you can take to understand how data engineering works.

From a skills perspective, this means that data engineers specialize in ETLs (extract, transform, load), automation (usually with Python or other programming languages), data modeling/data warehousing, SQL and NoSQL data manipulation, and data visualization, to name a few.

The skills that are less known are skills like ETLs and data warehousing. Both of these are usually discussed more in master’s or certificate programs after getting your bachelor’s degree — although we suspect this will or has already changed.

More than likely you will need to learn these skills in some form of order.

Data science  and data engineering interviews, like other technical interviews, require plenty of preparation. There are a number of subjects that need to be covered in order to ensure you are ready for back-to-back questions on statistics, programming and machine learning.

Before we get started, there’s one tip I’d like to share.

If we just look at data science interview you will notice that there are several types of interviews that companies conduct.

Some data science interviews are very product and metric driven. These interviews focus more on asking product questions like what kind of metrics would you use to show what you should improve in a product. These are often paired with SQL and some Python questions.

The other type of data science interview tends to be a mix of programming and machine learning.

We recommend asking the recruiter if you aren’t sure which type of interview you will be facing. Some companies are very good at keeping interviews consistent, but even then, teams can deviate depending on what they are looking for. Here are some examples of what we have noticed about some companies data science interviews.

Airbnb — Product heavy, metrics diagnostics, metrics creation, A/B testing, tons of behavioral questions and take home material.

Netflix — Product-sense questions, A/B testing, experimental design, metric design

Microsoft — Programming heavy, binary tree traversal, SQL, machine learning

Expedia — Product, programming, SQL, product sense, machine learning questions about SVM, regression and decision tree

6RiA_Qur2yo,Seattle Data Guy,Being A Data Engineer: Expectations vs Reality,"What is a data engineer?

The goals of a data engineer are much more big-picture and development focused. Data engineers build automated systems and model data structures to allow data to be efficiently processed.

This means the goal of a data engineer is to create and develop tables and data pipelines to support analytical dashboards and other data customers (like data scientists, analysts, and other engineers). 

It's similar to most engineers. There is a lot of design, assumptions, limitations, and development that occurs to be able to create some sort of final robust system.

Jw4Or_FiT7k,Seattle Data Guy,What Are ETLs And Why We Use Them - For Data Scientists And Data Engineers,"The rise in self-service analytics is a significant selling point for data warehousing, automatic data integrations, and drag and drop dashboards. In fact, in 2020, the largest software IPO this year was a data warehousing company called Snowflake.

The question is how do you get your data from external application data sources into a data warehouse like Snowflake?

The answer is ETLs and ELTs.

ETLs (Extract, Transform, Load) are far from new but they remain a vital aspect of Business Intelligence (BI). With ETLs, data from different sources can be grouped into a single place for analytics programs to act on and realize key business insights.

ELTs have the same exact steps referenced by ETLs except in a slightly different order. In particular, the major difference lies in when the transform step occurs. We will discuss in depth what the T stands for shortly. 

However, to talk about it abstractly, it references business logic, data pivoting and transformations that often take a lot of time and resources to maintain.

In addition to covering what the E, L, and T stand for, this article will also cover the ETL process and various tools.

NPSQN9cRL3s,Seattle Data Guy,Preparing For A Data Engineering Interview: How To Design A Data Warehouse For.A Food Delivery App,"Data warehouses (in all their forms and iterations) have become the backbone of almost every organizations analytics, data science and BI departments.

Over the years they have evolved and taken on new shapes as modern infrastructure has been developed to better manage analytical queries and workloads.

In our last few articles and videos we discussed why data warehouses are used as well as a high level for what they are used for.

Now we wanted to provide more depth to a data warehouse.

Beyond just talking about the high level reasons why you might want to incorporate a data warehouse into your infrastructure. We wanted to discuss the key design components.

A common interview question for data engineers and BI developers is to develop a data warehouse. Personally, I have been asked to design a parking lot data warehouse, a college courses data warehouse and several others for interviews.

I suggest that most people watch a few videos on the topic of data modeling as well as read up on Kimball’s data warehouse design book. After that, then you should think about a few workflows you might enjoy and practice modeling them.

For example, let’s walk through designing a data warehouse for a food delivery app.
How would you approach this design?

Generally, a good way to start is to list out the entities you would consider being part of a food delivery app.

For example here is a list:
* Menu Items(And possibly add-ons)
* Restaurants
* Drop Off Locations 
* Cars
* Persons(Customers and drivers, since a driver in the future might be a customer and visa versa)
* Orders

This would be a good high level set of entities to start with. Especially in an interview. You don’t want to focus on every possible issue and detail. 

I would list these out and prod the interviewer to see if this is all the entities they were concerned with. Often times interviewers have a specific set of questions they want to ask. So if you don’t include all the entities, they may ask about different parts of the workflow you might have forgotten.
From here, the dimensions it may be obvious. You have menu items, restaurants, drop off locations, cars and persons.

These are all dimensional items because they represent entities that don’t change often, don’t contain measurable data and can be used to pivot and break down your future reports.

VjlzuUzYJYM,Seattle Data Guy,What Is A Data Warehouse And Why Do We Build Them?,"We recently had a medium sized company ask us why they might want to build a data warehouse.

They had an operational relational database and a few ideas for products that we found brilliant. We saw clear ways that customers would benefit. However, we did have to take a moment to explain the value of a data warehouse.

Considering their data was small (under 500 GB). A data warehouse seemed like an appropriate fit for their uses cases they explained. As stated above, they had several products they wanted to develop to help better target customers and gain a competitive advantage.

Although most of our posts and projects are data science focused. Our projects often require us to be more than just analysts and data scientists. We also have to be data engineers and designers of data systems.

So here are some great reasons to invest in a data warehouse or other form of centralized data system that analysts and products can utilize.
But this brings up a great question.

What in the world is a data warehouse.

Honestly, many computer science and information system students won’t ever get taught what a data warehouse is.

Yet, almost every large corporation has multiple data warehouses.

ZalsNP6bMFg,Seattle Data Guy,Connecting To Big Query Using Jupyter Notebook On SaturnCloud Part 1,"Using cloud tools like Bigquery and SaturnCloud.io make data scientists, data engineers and analysts work much easier.

Both tools remove the need to manage as much infrastructure on your companies side and instead you can use AWS, Google cloud and Azure to run your analysis and manage your data only when needed.

Today we wanted to use discuss using these cloud tools that are available to everyone to analyze a medical data set. 

In particular will be using the Kaggle data set for medicare providers. This has information on diagnosis related groups average costs, hospital locations and interesting facts about providers and their service quality.

These data sets provide you the ability to answer questions about which states have the highest quality of service (based on the metrics they provide), the highest average costs as well as look into demographics of the patient bases. 

Since healthcare costs tend to be one of the largest focuses, we are going to look at which states have the largest percentage of costs that are above average. We will be using Saturn.io as a platform for our Jupyter notebook and BigQuery in order to query the data.

Tools We Will Use

Saturn.io
For those unfamiliar with tools like Saturn. Saturn.io allows you to easily spin up a VM that has already has Jupyter notebook installed. But it is really much more than just that.

Using Saturn.io makes it easy to share your work with other teammates without having to deal with the hassle of making sure they have all the correct libraries installed. Also, for those of you who have had the issue of running Jupyter Notebooks locally and run out of memory, it also allows you to spin up VMs with the memory and Ram required and only pay for what you use.

There are also a few other bells and whistles that really mitigate some of the complexities of work typically done from a DevOps perspective. That’s what makes tools like this great. In many ways, until you work in a corporate environment where even sharing a basic Excel document can become cumbersome, it is almost hard to explain to younger data scientists why this is so great!

Big Query
Due to where the data is being stored. We will also need to interact with Big Query. This is a Google Cloud service that allows you to query data. In this case, the medicare data is open to everyone but is stored on Google Cloud. 

As like most cloud services, this makes it convenient to manage as long as Google keeps this data public. It is really easy to pull the data and run queries without having to download a csv and load it into your own database.
Connecting to Big Query

For step one we will be retrieving the cms_medicare public data set. In order to do so you will need to set up Google API credentials (see instructions here). You will notice that the credentials don’t so much require an API key as much as the .json file that has the key as seen below.

from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.oauth2 import service_account
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
   filename=""JSON_KEYPATH""

)
client = bigquery.Client(
   credentials=credentials,
   project=credentials.project_id,
)
medicare = client.dataset('cms_medicare', project='bigquery-public-data')
Once you have set up your credentials you can then create a reference to a client. This will be your access point.

To get an understanding about what you are working with, you can actually print the list of tables in the cms_medicare data set. Using the code below you can iterate through the tables so you know what you are working with.

We will continue analyzing this data using SQL and python in our next video. Please let us know if you have any questions. Also check out the links below to learn more!

xc9C6xSX8xM,Seattle Data Guy,Connecting To SQL Server With Python - Creating A Database Object,"You will often need to connect to various databases when developing in any language.

In this video we will be discussing how to connect a python script to SQL Server. We will be doing this by creating a python class that is called Databasemanager.

This will allow us to create a one stop shop for running select and insert statements while also logging output. 

Instead of simply creating new connections every time and duplicating code such as logging.info over and over again all over your code. Using this class encapsulates alot of the steps you should be taking when connecting to SQL server.

However, after creating this I did realize I should have added some more try except blocks around attempting to connect. But I think this gets to the point. Please let me know what you think!

mo-FU0mGNx4,Seattle Data Guy,Loading JSON data Using Python - MeetUp API Data,"Once you have pulled data from an API like the Meetup API you will need to load it into a database to make it easier to analyze.

We have pulled the data into JSON and are loading it into the MySQL db. This video focuses mostly on how to load data in MySQL and less on design. If your goal is OOP, then this is not the video for you.

This video is just free flowing code and creating a python script that can load data from the MeetUp api on groups into MySQL. You can use this video as a primer for how you could start to set up an automated scraper that pulls from Meetup.

Due to the fact that I mostly programming on the fly there are some points that I skipped through to save you the hassle of watch me debug any minor issues. 


Once you have done that, you are pretty much set to go using the Meetup API. There is actually a python library for Meetup that you can pip install and then use import meetup.api. There are some benefits, but I think it is so easy to set up your own base scraper class that why limit your control.

Good luck on your data pulls!

OnzBuzRX3FE,Seattle Data Guy,Automating File Loading Into SQL Server With Python And SQL - Part 1,"Loading files into databases are not exactly exciting work. It can be tedious and boring work. Often times it is constrained by tools like SSIS that freak out when a small change is made.
This is one of the core roles of BI and data engineering teams. They need to load files from operational databases into data warehouses. They do this by developing pipelines that process and transform data.
One problem we see is teams have multiple file types, data spec versions, and data providers. Each of which requires a different pipeline just to load into their raw database.
This forces teams to manage 10, 20 maybe even 50 smaller pipelines that are all subject to the change of the data providers. In addition, each new data provider requires an entirely new pipeline to be developed. It also requires managing infrastructure around each pipeline in order to log and track data pipelines statuses. This can quickly become very difficult to manage and tedious to build.

 and we and now have worked on a video that is below that walks through the process. We wanted to discuss why each stage is important and what occurs when data goes from raw to stage, why do we need a raw database and so on.

Data engineering is a complex discipline that partners automation, programming, system design, databases, and analytics in order to ensure that analysts, data scientists and end-users have access to clean data.

This all starts with the basic ETL design.

We are practicing up for a webinar that we will be hosting on ETL development with Python and SQL. The webinar itself will be much more technical and dive much deeper into each component described in the video. However, we wanted to see how using the whiteboard was like in case we need it.

2qM3UlX8zTo,Seattle Data Guy,Creating Logging Tables For ETLS - SQL Best Practices,"Logging is an important step in automation and ETL development.

In order to know where problems occur and where performance can be improved you need to know where the issues are.

This is where good logging comes in. Creating a solid system that logs what stored procedures and scripts are being run inside your ETL/Automated system ensure that you can maintain and fix future problems.

EWSYgkv8kaw,Seattle Data Guy,Avoid Divide By Zero Errors In SQL - SQL Best Practices,"When you create an ETL or a metric that has ratios or division in general, it is important to consider that fact that at some point in the future the denominator could be 0.

This will cause a divide by 0 error that will most likely break your system, ETL, or adhoc query. 

If you are trying to build an automated system, this will be a thorn in your side.

This video will discuss how to avoid a divide by 0 error.

t1RRvoXP3X0,Seattle Data Guy,How To Improve Your SQL Skills - Best Practices SQL,"Division can be tricky when it comes to programming and SQL. This is because computers strictly hold data types. 

What this means is that if in your scope the value you are referring to is an int it can only produce an int. 

This means that if you were to try to dived 5/2 you won't get 2.5 but instead you get 2 and the extra one will be the remainder. Where as had you divided 5.0/2 then you will get 2.5.

So how do you ensure that the math is calculated correctly? Watch the video to find out.

XecU6Ieyu-4,Seattle Data Guy,Calculating A Bucketed Median With SQL,"This video will discuss a unique problem for SQL.

This video will discuss calculating the median when the values are pre-aggeragated.

Let's say you have a table that already has data group by ages. So your data points are [age: 18, count: 20] [age: 19, count 11] [age: 20, count: 9]. How would you find the median without taking the data out of aggregated form?

Keeping in the data in this format could save space and compute time. Imagine if you needed to calculate the median for terabytes of data. If this data was stored in an aggregated format, it could save a lot of time.","sql, analytics, big data, calculation, science, data science, math, sql server, data, tech, microsoft",6024,53,0,11,339.0,hd,false,Sunday,2019-01-27,06:53:05

lS6CfQbexN0,Seattle Data Guy,Analyzing Consecutive Events With SQL Server,"Whether you are comparing the average amount of time between visits per customer or trying to figure out how many patients are readmitted every 30 days. The problem is the same in a traditional DB.

How do you compare to events for the same customer or patient. Since data is in a row format you can't easily do this.

However, you can use an analytic function to create a row number and self join your tables together to create this effect.

In this video we will be discussing why you might want to compare consecutive events and how you would go about doing it.

If you prefer reading, then you can read the basic how to here (Just skip to the part about joining consecutive events)

G3kYPzLWtpo,Seattle Data Guy,Calculating A Running Total With SQL,"SQL is the language of data. It can be used to answer countless questions in any company (unless that company still runs 100% off mainframes).
 
The ubiquity of data makes SQL one of the most utilized technical skills whether you are a data engineer, analyst, or data scientist.

One of the problems you may have to solve is calculating a rolling sum. There are many ways to approach this problem. You can use an analytic function, a self join, a subquery and even simply design.

In addition, they play a role in whether a time series is considered stationary or non-stationary.

The trend component will often have to be predicted separately as its own component in order to ensure for a better model.

VrJYOItZYLQ,Seattle Data Guy,Introduction To Time Series In R: The Decompose Function,"When developing time series models it can be helpful to understand the nature of the various patterns that exist inside the data.

For example, many times series data sets have both trend components and seasonal ones. When developing an ARIMA model, these components play a major role in deciding how many coefficients to have for the various parameters.

1NCVy8Tylx0,Seattle Data Guy,What Are Confounding Variables and How Do You Standardize Populations?,"A variable that is not considered but plays a role in the outcome of an event is considered a confounding factor. 

In epidemiology, a confounding variable refers to a variable that is a risk factor for a disease or is associated to the exposure of the disease but is not the actual exposure. Confounding variables are not limited to a disease. When developing algorithms for product recommendations, A/B testing or market segmentation confounding variables can creep in. 
 
This can lead to invalid conclusions and incorrect comparisons. When developing algorithms and researching correlations it is important to attempt to parse out as many of these variables as possible. 

Sometimes this means breaking down populations into categories and other times it involves standardizing populations to more fairly depict the data patterns associated in different populations.

This video will demonstrate how to standardize those populations.","math, epidemiology, statistics, analytics, algorithms, correlations, data, healthcare, health",2524,18,0,4,674.0,hd,false,Tuesday,2018-05-29,05:15:48
KgHtG0OI1fg,Seattle Data Guy,Introduction To Time Series In R: Measuring Predictive Model Quality,"When developing predictive models and algorithms, whether linear regression or ARIMA models it is important to quantify how well the model fits to the future observations. One of the simplest methods of calculating how correct a model is uses the error between the predicted value and the actual value. From there, there are several methodologies that take this difference and further exploit meaning from it. Quantifying the accuracy of an algorithm is an important step to justifying the usage of the algorithm in product.
